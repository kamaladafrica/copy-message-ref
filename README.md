# Copy Message Ref

This is a simple extension that adds a button to the message header toolbar to
copy the message refs to the clipboard. This is useful for pasting email
reference.

Example:

Mario Rossi <mario.rossi@email.it>, 30/4/2020, 18:25:05, Fwd: Meeting

## Installation

Create a .xpi by running `make` and install it.
